def sentence_generator(list):
  #The idea behind the sentence generator is to make different building blocks - sentences, or lines (they're serving the same purpose here) - that I can generate randomly and string together into verses, and then into a poem.
  #I decided to use lists as the function's argument, just so I can have one place with all of the words, split into different parts, for the function to pick from. It also helps because now I can make different lists with different types of words - or collections of words with different vibes - and find ways to use multiple, different lists in the poetry generator
  sentence = ((adjective + " " + pronoun + " " + verb + " " + connect + " " + noun))
  #The "sentence" variable marks the order that specific types of words are going to be used in the list, and then put together to make a line or sentence, i.e. an adjective is randomly picked and put in the sentence first, followed by a pronoun, and then a verb and so on. I don't know anything about animal psychology, but I want the order of the words to be based on the order that different parts of information - the immediate senses, processed into the person, and then the action - are transmitted to the brain.
