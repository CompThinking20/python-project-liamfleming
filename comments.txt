Your first step here is going to be correcting your project structure by getting rid of that folder and moving the file inside it into the main part of the repository to reduce a bit of complexity when dealing with Git. Also remember that your filename for your project file should end in .py and have no spaces in it. The code itself looks like it's going to do what you want, but I can't run it in its current state to tell you whether it actually is or not. For your next milestone, I recommend looking for ways to increase complexity and randomness, such as finding ways to change up the order of the words, so the parts of speech don't always come in the same order. Although obviously doing this increases your chance of putting out gibberishâ€”welcome to the wonderful world of text generation!

The code is running and giving output, which is great. And the pattern you used to respond to my previous comments is spot on. My recommendation for your final submission is to create more variation between the lines and also to play with the capitalization since it feels quite random at the moment. But right now the same words are used in varying order in essentially every poem. How can you add a little more variety while retaining some cohesion?
